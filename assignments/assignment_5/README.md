# CS3219 Assignment 5

A web application with a frontend and backend, using RabbitMQ as a Message Queue for matchmaking service.

The following objectives are achieved:

- Let the user match using RabbitMQ, a queuing technology under AMQP.
- Develop a front-end that communicates with the back-end for matching services.
- Enhancement of the front-end by integrating the front end from Assignment 2 into Assignment 5, using the auth. 

This project was created using the front-end from Assignment 2

## Set-up

### Navigate to the current project directory

After cloning the project in your personal device, navigate the directory to ay2324s1-course-assessment-g33/assignments/assignment_5 using `cd` commands in the terminal.

There are two folders, `backend` and `frontend`.

### Backend

Within the project directory, create an environment file `.env` by making a copy of `.env.example`. You can request for the environment file containing our API secrets from our group over email, at woobt123@gmail.com.
This allows you to access RabbitMQ and sets the matchmaking timeout.

#### `npm i`

This installs the necessary node module packages key to running the assignment.
Please ensure that your node version is set to version 16, with npm version set to version 8.

#### `npm run match`

Runs the matchmaking backend service, to allow set up the RabbitMQ communications.

#### `npm run sock`

Runs the matchmaking socket backend service, to allow communication between the server and client.

### Frontend

Within the project directory, create an environment file `.env` by making a copy of `.env.example`. You can request for the environment file containing our API secrets from our group over email, at woobt123@gmail.com.
This allows you to access Firebase and sets the matchmaking timeout.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm i`

This installs the necessary node module packages key to running the assignment.
Please ensure that your node version is set to version 16, with npm version set to version 8.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

On successful set-up, your browser should look as follows:

## User Guide

### Authentication

Please refer to [Assignment 2's user guide for authentication](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g33/blob/master/assignments/assignment_2/README.md)

### Matching

After the user is logged in, he will be presented with three buttons to show which queue he wants to be match in.

The matching is currently set to 5s for demonstration purposes.

After a successful match, the match code/room will be shown.

If no matches are found, message will be shown to the user.

![fail](https://github.com/francisyzy/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g33/assets/24467184/b2194ca5-0f4d-46f0-96e8-018b06939449)

## Requirements Fulfilled

- Demonstrating the two usersâ€™ inputs to specify the criteria for matching
- Front-end timer + feedback + handling no match
- Demonstrating the valid matching
- Containerizing the application
